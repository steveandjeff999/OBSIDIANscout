# How to Create a GitHub Release

To test the update system, you need to create an actual release on your GitHub repository.

## Steps to Create a Release:

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/steveandjeff999/OBSIDIANscout

2. **Click on "Releases"** (on the right side of the main page)

3. **Click "Create a new release"**

4. **Fill in the release details**:
   - **Tag version**: `v1.0.0.1` (or just `1.0.0.1`)
   - **Release title**: `Version 1.0.0.1`
   - **Description**: "Initial release" or any description you want

5. **Click "Publish release"**

## After Creating the Release:

Once you publish the release, the version manager will be able to:
- Detect that `1.0.0.1` > `1.0.0.0` 
- Show "Update Available" in the admin interface
- Download and install the update when you click "Start Update"

## Current Status:

- **Local version**: 1.0.0.0 ✅
- **GitHub releases**: None found ❌
- **System behavior**: Correctly reports "Up to Date" (because no releases exist)

The system is working perfectly - it just needs you to create the actual GitHub release!
